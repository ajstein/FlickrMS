==ABOUT==
This application can be used to mount a Flickr account directly onto a users
file system. The photos will seem to be on the local machine but all changes done
will also affect the users Flickr account.

Photos will be placed in directories that represent which photoset the photo
belongs to. If a photo does not belong to a photoset, the photo will appear in
the root director (the directory used to mount FlickrFS). A photo that has an
empty name in Flickr, will display its flickr photo id instead on FlickrFS.

==INSTALLATION==
Dependencies:
	FUSE (tested on fuse-2.8.5)
		http://fuse.sourceforge.net/
	>=Flickcurl-1.20
		http://librdf.org/flickcurl/

You must allow the access of FlickrFS to your Flickr account. FlickrFS uses
Flickcurl to talk with Flickr. You must setup ~/.flickcurl.conf as follows:

$ cat ~/.flickcurl.conf
[flickr]
api_key=2e66493ec959256a79e4e5a3da7df729
secret=c1b99d47790391c3
$

Then visit:
http://www.flickr.com/services/auth/?mobile=1&api_key=2e66493ec959256a79e4e5a3da7df729&perms=delete&api_sig=6417abca6880d676c010600e8c65a045
and select:
[OK, I'LL AUTHORIZE IT]

This will allow the user the ability to link their Flickr account with FlickrFS.
The user will be given a 9-digit FROB that can be given to the flickcurl api to
link the user's account to the interface. Finally, execute:

flickcurl -a 123-456-789

where 123-456-789 is the 9-digit FROB given to the user above. This will finish
the linking of the user's account with the flickcurl API and library and the
user should then see the following format in their configuration file:

$ cat ~/.flickcurl.conf
[flickr]
auth_token=-------
api_key=2e66493ec959256a79e4e5a3da7df729
secret=c1b99d47790391c3
$

See http://librdf.org/flickcurl/ for more information on Flickrcurl API
configuration and http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/72157623762128193/
for the info on the api key and secret of FlickrFS.

FlickrFS comes with a custom Makefile that can be used to create the binary
application.



==Q/A==
Q: Why isn't the flickcurl.pc file not able to be found by pkg-config?

A: It is installed in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig by default. You will have to add
this directory to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable using the command:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/
